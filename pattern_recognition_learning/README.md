# Pattern Recognition and Neural Network Modeling Program

## Overview
I have implemented a Python program to help learners understand pattern recognition and neural network modeling through hands-on implementation. The program uses the MNIST dataset (handwritten digit recognition) as a case study and incorporates advanced techniques such as data augmentation, transfer learning, and evaluation metrics.

I have designed the program to be modular, with each function handling a specific task within the machine learning workflow, including data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model building, training, and evaluation.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing:** I have implemented normalization, reshaping, and one-hot encoding of data.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** I have implemented visualization of sample images and class distribution.
- **Data Augmentation:** I have implemented artificial dataset expansion using transformations like rotation, shifting, and zooming.
- **Neural Network Modeling:** I have built and trained a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) with dropout layers for regularization.
- **Advanced Training Techniques:**
  - I have implemented a Learning Rate Scheduler to dynamically adjust the learning rate during training.
  - I have implemented Early Stopping to stop training when validation performance stops improving.
  - I have implemented Model Checkpointing to save the best-performing model during training.
- **Evaluation Metrics:**
  - I have implemented a classification report (precision, recall, F1-score).
  - I have implemented a confusion matrix to visualize true vs predicted labels.
  - I have implemented ROC-AUC curves for multi-class classification.
- **Transfer Learning:** I have demonstrated how to use a pre-trained VGG16 model for feature extraction.
