# pattern_recognition_learning
Here I learnt pattern recognition and neural network modeling. I have combined theoretical concepts with practical implementation, enabling me to develop a strong foundation in deep learning. By experimenting with the code and extending its functionality, I can deepen my understanding and apply these techniques to real-world problems.
